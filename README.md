This is part of a summer project that I did with Dr. Sachin Jain as part of the SSPC programme of IISER Pune. The topic of this internship is 'Time Series Analysis and Evolution',
and we are using it to analysis financial time series and predict future trends and understand when to buy/sell assets and liabilities. Most of our time got spent in just understand-
ing how finance works, and got to understand fundamental analysis and technical analysis methods. We worked mostly wit creating detailed prompts for AI (Grok/Claude) to give us a
detailed analysis report after going through the data available in the company's website. So, I have been trying to work on the time series part on my own, to use technical 
analysis on it.
